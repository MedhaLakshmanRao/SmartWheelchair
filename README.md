# SmartWheelchair
Touch 'n' roll

Wheelchairs are used by people who find walking extremely difficult/impossible due to some illness (physiological or physical), injury or disability. Such people rely heavily on their wheelchairs for transportation and it aims to provide them with 'mobility', something we cannot imagine our lives without. This project will mainly feature the movement of the wheelchair made possible with just slight movements of the userâ€™s fingers. As a future scope, we intend to customize this smart wheelchair by making the movement of the wheelchair possible with slight movements of the user's feet/head depending on his ailment. So currently, it is a kind of a wearable, which allows the user to move around in his wheelchair with a slight finger movement and also keeps a track of his health condition and warns a few pre-saved contacts in case of an emergency. As an added feature, he would also be able to control all the gadgets in his house/room using his voice alone.
